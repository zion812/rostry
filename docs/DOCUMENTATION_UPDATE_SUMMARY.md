## üìã Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation updates performed to align all documentation with the current implementation state of the ROSTRY project, particularly focusing on the newly implemented farm management system and access control features.

## üîç Analysis Findings

### Major Implementation Gaps Identified
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: RostryDatabase.kt showed version 6 with 15 entities, but 10+ new entities were implemented but not included
2. **Farm Management System**: Comprehensive farm management features were implemented but not documented
3. **Navigation Updates**: FarmManagementNavigation.kt added 11 new destinations not reflected in documentation
4. **Repository Implementations**: New repositories (FarmRepository, FarmAccessRepository) were implemented but not documented

### Critical Issues Fixed in v2.1.0
- **Missing Entities**: VaccinationRecord and Bloodline entities were in database but not documented
- **Missing Migration**: DatabaseModule.kt was missing MIGRATION_6_7 reference
- **Incorrect Entity Counts**: Documentation showed 25+ entities but actual count is 28
- **Missing Data Models**: Analytics data classes were not documented
- **Database Inconsistencies**: Schema documentation didn't match actual implementation

### Implemented but Previously Undocumented Features
